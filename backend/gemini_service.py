"""
ENHANCED KEYWORD-BASED STATIC RESPONSE SYSTEM

This module implements a sophisticated keyword-based static response system for negotiations.
When Gemini API is unavailable or fails, the system uses intelligent keyword detection to 
generate dynamic, context-aware responses.

KEYWORD CATEGORIES AND RESPONSES:
1. PRICE_LOW_KEYWORDS: ['low', 'too low', 'very low', 'not enough', 'insufficient', 'can\'t accept', 'won\'t work']
   - Responses: Market-based justifications, slight price increases, persistence

2. AGREEABLE_KEYWORDS: ['ok', 'okay', 'fine', 'alright', 'sounds good', 'agreed', 'deal', 'accept', 'yes'] 
   - Responses: Deal closure, logistics coordination, contact exchange

3. NEGOTIATION_KEYWORDS: ['counter', 'negotiate', 'how about', 'what about', 'consider', 'think about']
   - Responses: Open to discussion while maintaining target price

4. EXPENSIVE_KEYWORDS: ['expensive', 'high', 'too much', 'costly', 'pricey', 'beyond budget']
   - Responses: Value justification, market comparisons, finding middle ground

5. URGENCY_KEYWORDS: ['urgent', 'quick', 'asap', 'immediately', 'today', 'now', 'fast']
   - Responses: Quick decision offers, immediate purchase readiness

6. GREETING_KEYWORDS: ['hi', 'hello', 'hey', 'good morning', 'good afternoon']
   - Responses: Professional introductions with immediate price offers

NEGOTIATION APPROACHES:
- ASSERTIVE: Direct, confident, market-research backed responses
- DIPLOMATIC: Balanced, collaborative, solution-focused responses  
- CONSIDERATE: Polite, budget-conscious, appreciation-focused responses

Each response is dynamically selected based on:
- Seller's keywords
- Negotiation approach preference
- Target price and budget constraints
- Product information
- Conversation context
